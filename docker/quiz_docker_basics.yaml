    question: What is a Docker container?
    options:
      - A standardized unit of software that packages code and all its dependencies
      - A virtual machine for hosting complex application environments
      - A physical server used for managing cloud-based applications
      - A network protocol designed for communicating between systems
    explanation: A Docker container is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.

    question: What is a Dockerfile?
    options:
      - A text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image
      - A container configuration file for setting runtime parameters
      - A network settings file for managing container communication
      - A log file containing activity records of running containers
    explanation: A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.

    question: What is Docker Hub?
    options:
      - A public registry for sharing and downloading Docker images
      - A container orchestration tool for managing large deployments
      - A monitoring system for observing container resource usage
      - A backup service for storing containerized application data
    explanation: Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service that allows you to download Docker images, store your own images, and share them with others.

    question: What is the purpose of Docker volumes?
    options:
      - To store and share data between containers and the host system
      - To increase container performance by reducing startup time
      - To improve network speed for containerized applications
      - To reduce image size by optimizing data storage
    explanation: Docker volumes are used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers, allowing data to be shared between containers and the host system.
