    question: What are the implications of using 'init' process in Docker Compose services?
    options:
      - It ensures proper process management and zombie process cleanup
      - It only affects startup time
      - It only manages logging
      - It only impacts resource usage
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Using 'init' process ensures proper handling of signals and zombie processes in containers, improving container lifecycle management.

    question: How do you implement custom logging drivers and configurations?
    options:
      - Using the logging driver configuration with custom options
      - Through basic logging only
      - Using environment variables
      - By manual log collection
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Custom logging can be implemented by specifying logging drivers (fluentd, syslog, etc.) and their options in the logging configuration.

    question: How do you handle sensitive data in build-time arguments?
    options:
      - Using build secrets and secure build contexts
      - Through environment variables only
      - Using plain text in Dockerfile
      - By manual input only
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Sensitive build-time data should be handled using build secrets and secure build contexts to prevent exposure in image layers.

    question: How do you implement custom health check scripting in Docker Compose?
    options:
      - By creating complex health check commands with shell scripting
      - Using basic ping checks only
      - Through external monitoring only
      - By manual inspection
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Complex health checks can be implemented using shell scripts and custom commands in the healthcheck configuration to perform detailed health assessments.

    question: How do you implement service scaling with volume management?
    options:
      - Using named volumes with proper configuration for concurrent access
      - Through basic volume mounts
      - Using local storage only
      - By manual volume creation
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Service scaling with volumes requires careful configuration of named volumes and storage drivers to handle concurrent access from multiple service instances.
