    question: How do you implement custom networking with network drivers in Docker Compose?
    options:
      - By specifying custom drivers and options in the networks section of the file
      - By using basic network settings to manage container communication
      - Through environment variables for network customization settings
      - Using command line tools to configure networking manually
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Custom networking can be implemented by defining networks with specific drivers (overlay, macvlan, etc.) and driver options in the networks section.

    question: What are the implications of using 'init' process in Docker Compose services?
    options:
      - It ensures proper process management and zombie process cleanup within containers
      - It only affects the startup time of services during initialization
      - It only manages logging and monitoring tasks for containers
      - It only impacts the resource usage allocated for running services
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Using 'init' process ensures proper handling of signals and zombie processes in containers, improving container lifecycle management.

    question: How do you implement custom logging drivers and configurations?
    options:
      - Using the logging driver configuration with specific options in the compose file
      - Through basic logging configurations available in default settings
      - Using environment variables to customize log handling processes
      - By manual log collection through external systems or tools
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Custom logging can be implemented by specifying logging drivers (fluentd, syslog, etc.) and their options in the logging configuration.

    question: How do you handle sensitive data in build-time arguments?
    options:
      - Using build secrets and secure build contexts for data protection
      - Through environment variables included during the build process
      - Using plain text directly embedded within the Dockerfile layers
      - By manual input of sensitive data during the build execution process
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Sensitive build-time data should be handled using build secrets and secure build contexts to prevent exposure in image layers.

    question: How do you implement custom health check scripting in Docker Compose?
    options:
      - By creating complex health check commands with shell scripting capabilities
      - Using basic ping checks as a default option for health verifications
      - Through external monitoring tools integrated with the Docker ecosystem
      - By manual inspection of container logs and runtime status updates
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Complex health checks can be implemented using shell scripts and custom commands in the healthcheck configuration to perform detailed health assessments.

    question: How do you implement service scaling with volume management?
    options:
      - Using named volumes with proper configuration for handling concurrent access
      - Through basic volume mounts provided by the default Docker settings
      - Using local storage solutions for scaling without additional setup
      - By manual volume creation and assignment for each service instance
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Service scaling with volumes requires careful configuration of named volumes and storage drivers to handle concurrent access from multiple service instances.

    question: How do you implement custom DNS resolution in Docker Compose?
    options:
      - Using custom DNS servers and search domains in the compose configuration
      - Through basic DNS settings available in the Docker networking options
      - Using external DNS servers exclusively for handling container resolution
      - By manual DNS configuration for each container deployed in the service
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Custom DNS resolution can be implemented by configuring DNS servers, search domains, and options in the compose file for specific services.

    question: How do you implement advanced resource quotas and limits?
    options:
      - Using combination of deploy, resources, and ulimits configurations in Compose
      - Through basic resource limits provided in default container settings
      - Using environment variables for defining container resource allocation
      - By manual monitoring and adjustments for individual services and containers
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Advanced resource management requires combining deploy resources, ulimits, and other configurations to implement comprehensive resource controls.

    question: How do you implement service discovery patterns in Docker Compose?
    options:
      - Using networks, aliases, and labels for enabling automatic service discovery
      - Through basic networking configurations to establish service connectivity
      - Using external services or APIs for managing service discovery processes
      - By manual configuration and routing for each container in the network
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Service discovery patterns can be implemented using a combination of networks, aliases, labels, and custom configurations to enable automatic service discovery.
