    question: What is the purpose of Elasticsearch's Cross-cluster Replication (CCR)?
    options:
      - To replicate indices from one cluster to another for disaster recovery and data locality
      - To compress data across clusters
      - To manage user permissions between clusters
      - To synchronize cluster settings
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Cross-cluster Replication (CCR) enables replication of indices from one Elasticsearch cluster to another, providing disaster recovery capabilities and data locality for geographically distributed deployments.

    question: How does Elasticsearch's Index Lifecycle Management (ILM) work?
    options:
      - By automating index management through defined phases and actions
      - By manually managing indices
      - By deleting old indices only
      - By compressing indices
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: ILM automates index management by defining phases (hot, warm, cold, delete) and actions to take during each phase, helping to optimize performance and resource usage over time.

    question: What is the purpose of Logstash's Persistent Queue?
    options:
      - To provide disk-based buffering for reliability during pipeline disruptions
      - To manage memory usage only
      - To compress log data
      - To encrypt data in transit
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Persistent Queue provides disk-based buffering in Logstash, ensuring data durability during pipeline disruptions and preventing data loss during restarts or outages.

    question: What is Elasticsearch's Field Data Type 'nested' used for?
    options:
      - To index arrays of objects and maintain their relationships
      - To store nested JSON structures
      - To create hierarchical data
      - To compress complex data
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The 'nested' field type is used to index arrays of objects while maintaining their relationships, allowing for accurate querying of object arrays where each object is indexed independently.

    question: What is the purpose of Kibana's Elastic Maps?
    options:
      - To visualize and analyze location-based data with multiple layers and data sources
      - To create basic geographical charts
      - To store map data
      - To generate map thumbnails
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Elastic Maps is a powerful tool for visualizing and analyzing location-based data, supporting multiple layers, data sources, and custom styling for complex geospatial analysis.

    question: How does Elasticsearch's Search Template feature enhance search operations?
    options:
      - By parameterizing search requests for reuse and simplified client integration
      - By caching search results
      - By compressing search queries
      - By limiting search scope
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Search Templates allow you to parameterize search requests, making them reusable and easier to maintain, while simplifying client integration by separating query logic from application code.

    question: What is the purpose of Logstash's Multiple Pipeline feature?
    options:
      - To run multiple pipelines with different configurations and resource allocations
      - To backup pipeline configurations
      - To test pipeline configurations
      - To monitor pipeline performance
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Multiple Pipeline feature allows running separate pipelines with different configurations and resource allocations, enabling better resource utilization and pipeline isolation.

    question: What is Elasticsearch's Snapshot Lifecycle Management (SLM)?
    options:
      - To automate the process of taking and managing index snapshots
      - To manage system backups
      - To handle data replication
      - To monitor snapshot status
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: SLM automates the process of taking and managing index snapshots, allowing you to define policies for backup scheduling, retention, and repository management.

    question: What is Elasticsearch's Ingest Pipeline?
    options:
      - To process documents before indexing with a series of processors
      - To manage data input only
      - To handle document routing
      - To compress incoming data
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Ingest Pipeline allows you to process documents before indexing using a series of processors, enabling data transformation, enrichment, and normalization at ingestion time.
