    question: What is the purpose of Elasticsearch's Cross-cluster Replication (CCR)?
    options:
      - To replicate indices from one cluster to another for disaster recovery and data locality
      - To compress data across clusters to save disk space efficiently
      - To manage user permissions between clusters securely
      - To synchronize cluster settings and configurations automatically
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Cross-cluster Replication (CCR) enables replication of indices from one Elasticsearch cluster to another, providing disaster recovery capabilities and data locality for geographically distributed deployments.

    question: How does Elasticsearch's Index Lifecycle Management (ILM) work?
    options:
      - By automating index management through defined phases and actions
      - By manually managing indices to retain granular control
      - By deleting old indices only when disk space is low
      - By compressing indices periodically to optimize resource usage
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: ILM automates index management by defining phases (hot, warm, cold, delete) and actions to take during each phase, helping to optimize performance and resource usage over time.

    question: What is the purpose of Logstash's Persistent Queue?
    options:
      - To provide disk-based buffering for reliability during pipeline disruptions
      - To manage memory usage during peak processing workloads
      - To compress log data efficiently before sending it downstream
      - To encrypt data in transit for enhanced security compliance
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Persistent Queue provides disk-based buffering in Logstash, ensuring data durability during pipeline disruptions and preventing data loss during restarts or outages.

    question: What is Elasticsearch's Field Data Type 'nested' used for?
    options:
      - To index arrays of objects and maintain their relationships for precise queries
      - To store nested JSON structures directly within Elasticsearch documents
      - To create hierarchical data structures for improved search accuracy
      - To compress complex data for better performance and resource utilization
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The 'nested' field type is used to index arrays of objects while maintaining their relationships, allowing for accurate querying of object arrays where each object is indexed independently.

    question: What is the purpose of Kibana's Elastic Maps?
    options:
      - To visualize and analyze location-based data with multiple layers and data sources
      - To create basic geographical charts to present location data graphically
      - To store map data for later use in dashboards or visualizations
      - To generate map thumbnails quickly for sharing in reports or presentations
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Elastic Maps is a powerful tool for visualizing and analyzing location-based data, supporting multiple layers, data sources, and custom styling for complex geospatial analysis.

    question: How does Elasticsearch's Search Template feature enhance search operations?
    options:
      - By parameterizing search requests for reuse and simplified client integration
      - By caching search results to reduce redundant processing workloads
      - By compressing search queries to minimize payload sizes in transit
      - By limiting search scope to specific indices or types of data efficiently
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Search Templates allow you to parameterize search requests, making them reusable and easier to maintain, while simplifying client integration by separating query logic from application code.

    question: What is the purpose of Logstash's Multiple Pipeline feature?
    options:
      - To run multiple pipelines with different configurations and resource allocations
      - To backup pipeline configurations periodically for disaster recovery
      - To test pipeline configurations in isolated environments before production
      - To monitor pipeline performance metrics for optimization purposes
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Multiple Pipeline feature allows running separate pipelines with different configurations and resource allocations, enabling better resource utilization and pipeline isolation.

    question: What is Elasticsearch's Snapshot Lifecycle Management (SLM)?
    options:
      - To automate the process of taking and managing index snapshots efficiently
      - To manage system backups across multiple nodes for redundancy
      - To handle data replication between different clusters seamlessly
      - To monitor snapshot status and resolve errors automatically
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: SLM automates the process of taking and managing index snapshots, allowing you to define policies for backup scheduling, retention, and repository management.
