    question: What is a virtual network switch (vSwitch) in ESXi?
    options:
      - A software switch that provides network connectivity to virtual machines
      - A physical network switch
      - A router
      - A firewall
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: A virtual switch (vSwitch) is a software component that provides network connectivity to virtual machines and handles network traffic between VMs and physical network adapters.

    question: What is a snapshot in ESXi?
    options:
      - A point-in-time copy of a virtual machine's state
      - A backup of the ESXi host
      - A network configuration
      - A storage configuration
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: A snapshot captures the state of a virtual machine at a specific point in time, including memory, settings, and virtual disk states, allowing you to revert to that state if needed.

    question: What is thin provisioning in ESXi?
    options:
      - A storage allocation method that uses space only when needed
      - A memory management technique
      - A network configuration method
      - A backup strategy
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Thin provisioning is a method of optimizing storage utilization by allocating storage space to virtual disks only when it is actually needed, rather than pre-allocating all space upfront.
