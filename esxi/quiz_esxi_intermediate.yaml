    question: What is High Availability (HA) in vSphere?
    options:
      - A feature that automatically restarts VMs on other hosts if their host fails
      - A backup solution
      - A load balancing feature
      - A security feature
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: vSphere HA provides high availability for virtual machines by pooling them and the hosts into a cluster, monitoring them for failures, and restarting VMs on other hosts when needed.

    question: What is VMFS (Virtual Machine File System)?
    options:
      - A high-performance cluster file system for ESXi hosts
      - A backup file system
      - A network file system
      - A temporary file system
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: VMFS is a cluster file system that provides storage virtualization optimized for virtual machines, allowing multiple ESXi hosts to access the same storage concurrently.

    question: What is the purpose of vSphere Fault Tolerance?
    options:
      - To provide continuous availability by maintaining a secondary copy of a VM
      - To handle storage failures
      - To manage network redundancy
      - To provide backup services
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: vSphere Fault Tolerance creates and maintains a secondary copy of a virtual machine that can take over at any time, providing continuous availability.

    question: What is the purpose of Host Profiles in vSphere?
    options:
      - To automate host configuration and ensure consistency
      - To manage virtual machines
      - To configure storage settings
      - To handle network settings
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Host Profiles allow you to create a reference host configuration and apply that same configuration to other hosts, ensuring consistency across your environment.
