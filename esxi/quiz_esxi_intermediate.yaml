    question: What is VMFS (Virtual Machine File System)?
    options:
      - A high-performance cluster file system for ESXi hosts
      - A backup and recovery file system for virtual machines
      - A network-based file system for sharing data
      - A temporary storage system for snapshots and logs
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: VMFS enables ESXi hosts to share access to storage volumes and supports features like snapshots and Storage vMotion with high performance.

    question: What is the purpose of vSphere Fault Tolerance?
    options:
      - To provide continuous availability by maintaining a secondary copy of a VM
      - To manage storage replication between datacenters
      - To handle network redundancy for virtual machines
      - To ensure regular backups for business-critical VMs
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Fault Tolerance keeps a shadow VM in lockstep with the primary VM, ensuring instant failover and zero downtime during host failures.
