    question: What is a Declarative Pipeline in Jenkins?
    options:
      - A simplified way to define Jenkins pipelines using predefined structure
      - A type of build agent
      - A monitoring system
      - A deployment tool
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Declarative Pipeline is a simplified way of writing Jenkins pipelines using a predefined structure and syntax, making it easier to create and maintain pipelines.

    question: What is a Scripted Pipeline in Jenkins?
    options:
      - A pipeline written using Groovy script with more flexibility
      - A type of plugin
      - A build trigger
      - A deployment script
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Scripted Pipeline uses Groovy scripting language, providing more flexibility and control over pipeline execution through programming constructs.

    question: What is a Multibranch Pipeline?
    options:
      - A pipeline that automatically creates jobs for branches in source control
      - A parallel execution system
      - A deployment strategy
      - A build configuration
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: A Multibranch Pipeline automatically creates pipeline jobs for each branch discovered in source control, allowing different branches to have different behaviors.

    question: What is Jenkins Credentials Binding?
    options:
      - A way to securely inject credentials into pipeline steps
      - A security protocol
      - A user authentication system
      - A backup strategy
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Credentials Binding allows you to securely inject credentials into pipeline steps without exposing sensitive information in the pipeline code.

    question: What is a Shared Library in Jenkins?
    options:
      - A collection of reusable code for pipelines
      - A plugin repository
      - A build agent
      - A deployment tool
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: A Shared Library is a collection of reusable code that can be shared across multiple Jenkins pipelines, promoting code reuse and maintainability.

    question: What is Pipeline Stage View?
    options:
      - A visualization of pipeline execution progress and results
      - A code editor
      - A build log
      - A configuration panel
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Pipeline Stage View provides a visualization of pipeline execution progress and results, showing the status of each stage and step in the pipeline.

    question: What is a Post Section in Jenkins Pipeline?
    options:
      - A block that runs at the end of pipeline or stage completion
      - A build notification
      - A deployment script
      - A cleanup process
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The Post section defines actions to be run at the end of a pipeline or stage based on the pipeline's status (success, failure, etc.).

    question: What is Pipeline Step?
    options:
      - A single task that is part of a pipeline
      - A build trigger
      - A deployment phase
      - A security check
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: A Pipeline Step is a single task that tells Jenkins what to do at a particular point in time during pipeline execution.

    question: What is Parallel Execution in Jenkins Pipeline?
    options:
      - Running multiple stages or steps simultaneously
      - A backup process
      - A deployment strategy
      - A build configuration
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Parallel execution allows multiple stages or steps to run simultaneously in a pipeline, reducing overall build time.

    question: What is a When Directive in Jenkins Pipeline?
    options:
      - A condition that determines if a stage should be executed
      - A build trigger
      - A deployment phase
      - A security check
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: The When directive allows you to specify conditions that must be met for a stage to execute in a pipeline.
