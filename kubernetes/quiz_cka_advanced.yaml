    question: How do you implement etcd backup and restore?
    options:
      - Configure and execute etcd snapshot operations with encryption
      - Monitor etcd cluster status without performing backup tasks
      - Manage etcd peer communication without snapshot capabilities
      - Display etcd metrics while skipping all backup procedures
    explanation: Regular etcd backups are crucial for cluster data protection and recovery.

    question: What is the purpose of cluster federation?
    options:
      - Coordinate multiple clusters across different geographic locations
      - Manage single cluster operations without federation support
      - Monitor cluster metrics without multi-cluster coordination
      - Configure local clusters while ignoring federation features
    explanation: Federation enables management of multiple Kubernetes clusters from a single control plane.

    question: How do you implement advanced scheduling policies?
    options:
      - Configure custom schedulers with complex pod placement rules
      - Monitor default scheduler without custom policy settings
      - Manage basic pod placement without advanced configurations
      - Track scheduler events while using default settings
    explanation: Custom schedulers enable advanced pod placement strategies beyond default configurations.

    question: What is the purpose of node taints?
    options:
      - Control pod scheduling through node repulsion mechanisms
      - Monitor node status without affecting pod placement
      - Manage node resources without scheduling considerations
      - Configure node labels without taint effect rules
    explanation: Taints allow nodes to repel pods that don't tolerate the taint.

    question: How do you implement container runtime security?
    options:
      - Configure advanced security policies for container execution
      - Monitor container status without security policy enforcement
      - Manage basic container operations without security controls
      - Track container metrics while ignoring security features
    explanation: Container runtime security ensures secure execution of containerized applications.

    question: What is the purpose of mutating admission webhooks?
    options:
      - Modify resource requests before persistence in etcd
      - Monitor admission requests without modification capabilities
      - Track webhook calls without changing request content
      - Display webhook metrics without mutation features
    explanation: Mutating admission webhooks can modify objects before they are persisted.

    question: What is the purpose of pod disruption budgets?
    options:
      - Ensure application availability during voluntary disruptions
      - Monitor pod status without disruption management features
      - Track pod metrics without availability guarantees
      - Configure basic pod settings without budget controls
    explanation: Pod disruption budgets limit voluntary disruptions to maintain availability.
