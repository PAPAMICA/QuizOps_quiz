    question: How do you configure RBAC authorization?
    options:
      - To implement role-based access control with specific permissions
      - To manage network policies without access control
      - To configure resource quotas without roles
      - To handle service accounts without permissions
    explanation: RBAC allows fine-grained access control through roles and bindings.

    question: What is the purpose of StatefulSets?
    options:
      - To manage stateful applications with stable network identities
      - To handle stateless deployments without persistence
      - To configure temporary storage solutions only
      - To manage network policies without state
    explanation: StatefulSets manage stateful applications with unique identities and stable storage.

    question: How do you implement network policies?
    options:
      - To control pod-to-pod communication with specific rules
      - To manage storage access without networking
      - To configure resource limits without policies
      - To handle service discovery without rules
    explanation: Network policies specify how pods communicate with each other and other endpoints.

    question: What is the purpose of PodSecurityPolicies?
    options:
      - To enforce security settings for pod creation and updates
      - To manage resource quotas without security
      - To configure network access without policies
      - To handle storage permissions without pods
    explanation: PodSecurityPolicies control security-sensitive aspects of pod specification.

    question: How do you manage persistent volumes?
    options:
      - To provide persistent storage with specific access modes
      - To handle temporary storage without persistence
      - To configure memory limits without volumes
      - To manage network storage without persistence
    explanation: Persistent volumes provide a way to store data independently of pod lifecycle.

    question: What is the purpose of CustomResourceDefinitions?
    options:
      - To extend Kubernetes API with custom resources
      - To manage built-in resources without extension
      - To configure standard objects only
      - To handle core APIs without customization
    explanation: CRDs allow you to define custom resources and extend the Kubernetes API.

    question: How do you implement pod affinity rules?
    options:
      - To control pod placement based on topology and labels
      - To manage resource allocation without placement
      - To configure networking without topology
      - To handle scheduling without affinity
    explanation: Pod affinity and anti-affinity allow you to constrain pod placement.

      - To manage storage without validation
      - To configure networking without admission
      - To handle authentication without control
    explanation: Admission controllers validate and modify requests to the Kubernetes API.

    question: What is the purpose of resource quotas?
    options:
      - To limit resource consumption within namespaces
      - To manage access control without limits
      - To configure storage without quotas
      - To handle networking without resources
    explanation: Resource quotas provide constraints that limit resource consumption per namespace.
