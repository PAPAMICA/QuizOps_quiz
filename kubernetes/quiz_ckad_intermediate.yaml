    question: How do you implement multi-container pods?
    options:
      - Define multiple containers sharing network and storage
      - Monitor single container pods without shared resources
      - Track container isolation without communication patterns
      - Display pod metrics without container coordination
    explanation: Multi-container pods enable containers to share resources and communicate locally.

    question: What is the purpose of init containers?
    options:
      - Execute setup tasks before application containers start
      - Monitor container startup without initialization steps
      - Track application state without setup procedures
      - Display container readiness without prerequisite checks
    explanation: Init containers perform initialization tasks before application containers run.

    question: How do you manage pod scaling?
    options:
      - Configure horizontal pod autoscaling with metrics
      - Monitor pod counts without scaling capabilities
      - Track resource usage without autoscaling rules
      - Display scaling status without metric analysis
    explanation: Horizontal Pod Autoscaling adjusts pod count based on metrics.

    question: What is the purpose of Jobs?
    options:
      - Run batch processes with completion guarantees
      - Monitor continuous processes without completion tracking
      - Track running tasks without completion status
      - Display job metrics without guarantee handling
    explanation: Jobs ensure batch tasks run to completion successfully.

    question: How do you handle pod affinity?
    options:
      - Control pod placement using node characteristics
      - Monitor pod distribution without placement rules
      - Track node selection without affinity settings
      - Display scheduling decisions without placement control
    explanation: Pod affinity influences pod placement based on node attributes.

    question: What is the purpose of CronJobs?
    options:
      - Schedule recurring tasks at specified intervals
      - Monitor periodic jobs without scheduling control
      - Track task execution without time patterns
      - Display job status without schedule management
    explanation: CronJobs create Jobs on a time-based schedule.

    question: How do you implement rolling updates?
    options:
      - Update applications gradually without service interruption
      - Monitor application versions without update strategy
      - Track deployment changes without rollout control
      - Display update status without version management
    explanation: Rolling updates provide zero-downtime application updates.

    question: What is the purpose of readiness probes?
    options:
      - Determine when pods are ready for traffic
      - Monitor pod health without readiness checks
      - Track container status without probe configuration
      - Display service availability without readiness tests
    explanation: Readiness probes indicate when pods can receive traffic.

    question: How do you manage pod security?
    options:
      - Configure security contexts for pod execution
      - Monitor pod access without security settings
      - Track container privileges without security controls
      - Display security status without context management
    explanation: Security contexts define privilege and access control settings.

    question: What is the purpose of StatefulSets?
    options:
      - Manage stateful applications with stable identities
      - Monitor stateless workloads without identity management
      - Track application state without persistence guarantees
      - Display pod status without identity controls
    explanation: StatefulSets provide unique identities and stable storage for pods.
