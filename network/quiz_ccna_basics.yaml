    question: What is the purpose of the OSI model?
    options:
      - To provide a standardized framework for understanding network communication protocols and functions
      - To define specific routing algorithms used exclusively by Cisco devices in enterprise networks
      - To establish proprietary networking standards that work only with Cisco equipment
      - To create hardware specifications for manufacturing networking equipment components
    explanation: The OSI model is a conceptual framework that standardizes network communication functions into seven abstraction layers.

    question: What is the function of a Layer 2 switch?
    options:
      - To forward frames between devices using MAC addresses within a local network
      - To determine optimal paths between networks using complex routing algorithms
      - To encrypt data transmissions between multiple network segments securely
      - To translate domain names into corresponding IP addresses automatically
    explanation: Layer 2 switches use MAC addresses to forward frames between devices within the same local network segment.

    question: What is the purpose of VLAN tagging?
    options:
      - To segment a physical network into multiple logical networks for traffic isolation
      - To compress network traffic data for efficient bandwidth utilization rates
      - To authenticate users accessing different portions of the network infrastructure
      - To monitor network performance metrics across multiple device interfaces
    explanation: VLAN tagging allows network administrators to create separate logical networks on a single physical infrastructure.

    question: What is the function of the DHCP protocol?
    options:
      - To automatically assign IP addresses and network configuration to client devices
      - To establish secure encrypted connections between network routing devices
      - To manage quality of service parameters for voice and video traffic
      - To synchronize time settings across multiple networking devices automatically
    explanation: DHCP automates the process of assigning IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices.

    question: What is the purpose of Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)?
    options:
      - To prevent network loops while maintaining redundant paths between switches
      - To optimize bandwidth allocation between multiple network connections actively
      - To secure wireless communications between access points and clients
      - To manage IP address assignments across different network segments
    explanation: STP prevents loops in switched networks while maintaining backup paths for redundancy.

    question: What is the function of an IP subnet mask?
    options:
      - To determine which portion of an IP address identifies network and host parts
      - To encrypt sensitive data transmissions between different network segments
      - To filter unwanted traffic based on predefined security policies
      - To compress network addresses for efficient routing table storage
    explanation: Subnet masks identify which bits in an IP address represent the network portion and which represent hosts.

    question: What is the purpose of ARP protocol?
    options:
      - To resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses for local network communication
      - To authenticate users accessing network resources across domains securely
      - To compress data packets for efficient network bandwidth utilization
      - To synchronize configuration settings between network devices automatically
    explanation: ARP maps IP addresses to MAC addresses, enabling communication on local networks.

    question: What is the function of a default gateway?
    options:
      - To provide a path for local devices to reach destinations on other networks
      - To store network configuration settings for all connected devices locally
      - To manage user authentication credentials across network segments securely
      - To monitor traffic patterns between different network interfaces actively
    explanation: A default gateway is a router that provides connectivity between local devices and other networks.
