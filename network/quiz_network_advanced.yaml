    question: What is BGP Route Reflection?
    options:
      - A method to scale BGP by reducing full-mesh requirements
      - A routing backup system
      - A traffic monitoring tool
      - A network security protocol
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: BGP Route Reflection is a method to scale BGP by allowing a router (route reflector) to advertise routes to clients, reducing the need for a full mesh.

    question: What is Network Microsegmentation?
    options:
      - A security approach that divides network into small, isolated segments
      - A network monitoring tool
      - A routing protocol
      - A bandwidth management system
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Network Microsegmentation is a security approach that divides the network into small, isolated segments to improve security and limit the spread of breaches.

    question: What is LISP?
    options:
      - Locator/ID Separation Protocol - separates location from identity
      - Local Internet Service Protocol
      - Link Interface Security Protocol
      - Layer Internet Security Protocol
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: LISP (Locator/ID Separation Protocol) is a network architecture that separates location and identity of network devices, improving routing scalability.

    question: What is PBR?
    options:
      - Policy-Based Routing - routes based on policies
      - Protocol-Based Routing
      - Path-Based Routing
      - Performance-Based Routing
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: PBR (Policy-Based Routing) allows routing decisions to be made based on policies set by the network administrator rather than routing protocols.

    question: What is Zero Trust Networking?
    options:
      - A security model that trusts nothing by default
      - A network testing methodology
      - A routing protocol
      - A bandwidth management system
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Zero Trust Networking is a security model that requires strict identity verification for every person and device trying to access resources on a network.
