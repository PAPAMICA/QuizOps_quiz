    question: What is NAT?
    options:
      - Network Address Translation - maps private to public IP addresses
      - Network Access Terminal
      - Network Authentication Tool
      - Network Address Terminal
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: NAT (Network Address Translation) is a method of mapping private IP addresses to a public IP address, enabling multiple devices to share a single public IP.

    question: What is OSPF?
    options:
      - Open Shortest Path First - a routing protocol
      - Open System Protocol Framework
      - Operating System Protocol Format
      - Open Source Protocol Function
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is a routing protocol that determines the best path for packets as they pass through a set of connected networks.

    question: What is a VLAN trunk?
    options:
      - A link that carries multiple VLANs between switches
      - A backup VLAN connection
      - A virtual router
      - A network monitoring tool
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: A VLAN trunk is a network link that carries traffic for multiple VLANs between switches, allowing VLANs to span across multiple switches.

    question: What is BGP?
    options:
      - Border Gateway Protocol - routes traffic between autonomous systems
      - Basic Gateway Protocol
      - Backup Gateway Protocol
      - Bridge Gateway Protocol
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is the protocol that makes core routing decisions on the Internet, routing traffic between autonomous systems.

    question: What is STP?
    options:
      - Spanning Tree Protocol - prevents network loops
      - Simple Transfer Protocol
      - System Transfer Protocol
      - Secure Transfer Protocol
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) prevents loops in network topologies by ensuring that there is only one active path between network segments.

    question: What is QoS?
    options:
      - Quality of Service - prioritizes network traffic
      - Query of Service
      - Quick Operating System
      - Quantum Operating System
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: QoS (Quality of Service) is a set of technologies that work on a network to guarantee its ability to dependably run high-priority applications and traffic.

    question: What is HSRP?
    options:
      - Hot Standby Router Protocol - provides network redundancy
      - High Speed Router Protocol
      - Host System Router Protocol
      - Hardware System Router Protocol
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) provides network redundancy for IP networks, ensuring that user traffic immediately recovers from first hop failures.

    question: What is Port Mirroring?
    options:
      - Copying network traffic for monitoring purposes
      - Creating backup ports
      - Connecting multiple ports
      - Securing network ports
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Port Mirroring is a feature that copies network traffic from one switch port (or VLAN) to another port for analysis and monitoring purposes.
