    question: What is the significance of quorum in Proxmox clustering?
    options:
      - Ensures cluster decisions are made by majority consensus
      - Manages backups
      - Controls network traffic
      - Handles storage
    correct_answer: 0
    explanation: Quorum ensures that cluster decisions are made only when a majority of nodes agree, preventing split-brain scenarios and maintaining cluster integrity.
