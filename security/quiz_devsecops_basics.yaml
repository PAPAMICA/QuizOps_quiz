    question: What is SAST?
    options:
      - Static Application Security Testing - analyzing source code for security vulnerabilities
      - A comprehensive network scanning tool for identifying system weaknesses
      - A real-time monitoring tool for application performance and security
      - A continuous deployment strategy for secure software releases
    explanation: SAST (Static Application Security Testing) analyzes source code or compiled versions of code to help find security vulnerabilities without executing the application.

    question: What is DAST?
    options:
      - Dynamic Application Security Testing - testing an application while it's running
      - A systematic code review process for identifying security vulnerabilities
      - A comprehensive backup strategy for securing application data
      - An automated compliance checking system for security standards
    explanation: DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) is a security testing methodology that analyzes a running application by simulating attacks from malicious users.

    question: What is the principle of least privilege?
    options:
      - Users and processes should only have the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks
      - All users should have administrative access to ensure maximum system efficiency
      - Sharing credentials between team members to facilitate collaboration
      - Using the same password across systems for simplified management
    explanation: The principle of least privilege states that every user and process should operate using the minimum set of privileges necessary to complete their job.
