    question: How does Non-Abstract Large System Design (NALSD) contribute to system reliability?
    options:
      - By providing a structured approach to designing large-scale systems with concrete implementation details
      - By simplifying system architecture
      - By reducing system complexity
      - By eliminating the need for monitoring
    explanation: NALSD contributes to reliability by providing a structured approach to designing large-scale systems that considers concrete implementation details, capacity planning, failure modes, and dependencies.

    question: What is the relationship between Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and the concept of "error budget burn rate"?
    options:
      - Error budget burn rate measures how quickly a service is consuming its error budget relative to the SLO time window
      - They are unrelated concepts
      - Error budget burn rate only applies to security incidents
      - SLOs are determined by burn rates
    explanation: Error budget burn rate indicates how quickly a service is consuming its error budget relative to the SLO time window, helping teams identify and respond to reliability issues before SLO breaches occur.

    question: How does the concept of "Production Readiness Review" (PRR) enhance system reliability?
    options:
      - By ensuring services meet specific reliability criteria before deployment to production
      - By replacing testing processes
      - By simplifying deployment procedures
      - By eliminating the need for monitoring
    explanation: PRR enhances reliability by ensuring services meet specific criteria for reliability, scalability, monitoring, and incident response before being deployed to production.
