    question: What is Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)?
    options:
      - A practice that incorporates aspects of software engineering and applies them to infrastructure and operations problems
      - A type of software development
      - A monitoring system
      - A deployment strategy
    explanation: SRE is a discipline that incorporates aspects of software engineering and applies them to infrastructure and operations problems, focusing on creating scalable and reliable software systems.

    question: What is Service Level Objective (SLO)?
    options:
      - A target value or range of values for a service level that is measured by SLIs
      - A monitoring tool
      - A deployment strategy
      - A type of alert
    explanation: An SLO is a target value or range of values for a service level that is measured by Service Level Indicators (SLIs), representing the reliability goals of the service.

    question: What is Error Budget?
    options:
      - The allowed amount of unreliability that can be tolerated before stopping feature development
      - A financial budget
      - A resource limit
      - A monitoring threshold
    explanation: An error budget is the maximum amount of time that a service can fail without violating its SLO, used to balance reliability and innovation.

    question: What is Service Level Indicator (SLI)?
    options:
      - A carefully defined quantitative measure of some aspect of the service level
      - A service agreement
      - A deployment strategy
      - A monitoring tool
    explanation: An SLI is a quantitative measure of some aspect of the level of service being provided, such as latency, availability, or error rate.

    question: What is Toil in SRE?
    options:
      - Manual, repetitive, and automatable work that scales linearly with service growth
      - A type of monitoring
      - A deployment strategy
      - A testing method
    explanation: Toil is the kind of work tied to running a production service that tends to be manual, repetitive, automatable, tactical, and devoid of enduring value.

    question: What is the purpose of Service Level Agreement (SLA)?
    options:
      - A contract that defines the expected service level and penalties for not meeting it
      - A monitoring system
      - A deployment strategy
      - An alert policy
    explanation: An SLA is an explicit or implicit contract with users that includes consequences of meeting (or missing) the service level objectives they contain.

    question: What is the Golden Signal in monitoring?
    options:
      - Latency, traffic, errors, and saturation
      - CPU usage only
      - Memory usage only
      - Network traffic only
    explanation: The four golden signals of monitoring are latency, traffic, errors, and saturation, which provide a comprehensive view of system health.

    question: What is Capacity Planning in SRE?
    options:
      - The process of determining the resources needed to meet future demand
      - A deployment strategy
      - A monitoring system
      - An alert policy
    explanation: Capacity planning is the process of determining what resources are needed to meet future demand while maintaining reliability and performance targets.

    question: What is the purpose of Postmortem in SRE?
    options:
      - A written record of an incident, its impact, actions taken, and follow-up work
      - A monitoring dashboard
      - A deployment plan
      - A testing strategy
    explanation: A postmortem is a written record of an incident, including its impact, the actions taken to mitigate or resolve it, and the follow-up actions to prevent recurrence.

    question: What is the principle of "Hope is Not a Strategy"?
    options:
      - Relying on systematic approaches rather than wishful thinking for reliability
      - A monitoring technique
      - A deployment method
      - A testing approach
    explanation: This principle emphasizes that reliability requires systematic approaches, automation, and proper engineering rather than hoping things will work out.
